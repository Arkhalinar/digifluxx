As long as the bonus point collection card of the customer is active, he will participate proportionately in the bonus point turnover of DIGIFLUXX. How fast the bonus grows depends on how many bonus points are generated in the bonus system. Therefore, the speed with which the bonus grows cannot be determined or guaranteed, as this depends on the turnover of all customers or the turnover of DIGIFLUXX.
The legal transaction is concluded with the purchase of advertising credits and thus also a bonus point collection card, or other offered products and services. Thus, the customer has no claim to bonus point participation or to the bonus program. The bonus distributions from the DIGIFLUXX bonus program can be regarded as a small thank-you to DIGIFLUXX for the loyalty, support and trust of the customer.
Paid purchase amounts for bonus point collection cards are non-refundable. The customer cannot redeem his bonus until his bonus has reached an appropriate minimum level. Redeemed bonuses have expired and cannot be redeemed again.";
